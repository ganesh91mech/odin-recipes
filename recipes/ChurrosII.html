    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a heavy deep skillet or deep-fryer, heat oil to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C). <br> 
            Oil should be about 1 1/2 inches deep.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, heat water and margarine to a rolling boil. <br> 
            Combine the flour and salt; stir into the boiling mixture. <br> 
            Reduce heat to low and stir vigorously until the mixture forms a ball, about 1 minute. <br> 
            Remove from heat and beat in the eggs one at a time. <br> 
            Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Carefully squeeze out 4 inch long strips of dough directly into the hot oil. <br> 
            Fry 3 or 4 strips at once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. <br> 
            Remove from hot oil to drain on paper towels. <br> 
            Stir together the sugar and cinnamon; roll churros in the mixture while still hot.
        </li>
    </ol>
